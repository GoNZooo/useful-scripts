# useful-scripts

This is just a collection of useful scripts, repository made for persistence sake.

## `stack`

Script that should work as a `stack` wrapper, which automatically chooses to pass `--nix` or not
depending on the state of the folder you are working in as well as the existence of `nix-env` in
your environment.
